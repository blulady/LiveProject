Live Project

Introduction

The live project was two weeks of working with my cohort as a team developing a MVC Web Application in Django. The was an excellent opportunity to get hands on experience with version control and working on a schedule. In those two weeks I learned how to use version control to prevent merge conflicts and uploading nonfunctional code, how to use Django Template Language while writing functions in Python for webpage functionality. I was working on web scraping pages for my site when we timed out. I was looking forward to working with an API. I was pushing so hard to get to these stories that I did not focus on the front as much as I could have.
I have full code files in this repository for further inspection.
